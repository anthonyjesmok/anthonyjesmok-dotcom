            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
            <p>I have been working as a developer professionally since 2013, but have been programming recreationally since I was 15 years old, when I took my first programming course in web development. Ever earlier than that, I remember playing with tools
              like Microsoft FrontPage to build small websites. Since then, I have continued working in the web and mobile development spaces.</p>
            <h4>Language Experience</h4>
            <p>The chart on this page shows my experience using various markup and programming languages. It shows what percent of my overall logged coding time was spent on each language.</p>
            <p>If you visit this page again later, it will likely change. This is because it retrieves real-time data from <a href="http://www.codeivate.com/users/anthonyjesmok" target="_new">Codeivate</a>, an IDE plug-in which tracks my coding time. This
              way, you are not just seeing rough estimates.</p>
            <h4>Frameworks</h4>
            <p>My coding experience involves working with many frameworks, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_new">WordPress</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.appcelerator.com/" target="_new">Appcelerator Platform (Mobile)</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://laravel.com/" target="_new">Laravel</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/" target="_new">Google App Engine</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_new">NodeJS</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://codeigniter.com/" target="_new">CodeIgniter</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_new">Bootstrap</a></li>

            <h3>Non-Technical Skills</h3>
            <p>When it comes to developing software products, it's not just the code that matters. There are other parts to the process as well that are just as important. Many of my work experiences have involved working in both the technical and non-technical
              side of software development.</p>
            <h4>Project Management</h4>
            <p>I have had the opportunity to serve in a project management or technical lead for some of the software products I have developed, such as the Sojourner Family Peace Center mobile application. Besides working on the development of the application
              itself, I also had to communicate with client stakeholders, generate reports, and manage tasks using project management tools.</p>
            <p>Besides my project experience, I also have taken coursework in project management. The Information Science and Technology degree at UWM contains hands-on coursework in project management using the JIRA sofware tool. I also hold a specialization
              in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/project-management" target="_new">Project Management Principles and Pratices from the University of California-Irvine, taken through Coursera.</a></p>
            <h4>Demonstrations and Presentations</h4>
            <p>While developing software products, my responsibilities have also included presenting and demonstrating products and reports to project stakeholders. These often involved framing technical concepts to a non-technical audience, answering questions
              about project progress, and evangelizing the organizations I have been a part of. As a Teaching Assistant, I lectured to groups of 30-50 students on technical skills. As a Google Student Ambassador, much of my programs held on campus were
              presentations about Google's products and opportunities, including a tech talk which had an attendance of over 100 students.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I have spoken at conferences and meetups on topics such as civic hacking and the Appcelerator Platform.</p>
            <h4>Other Non-Technical Skills</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Writing</li>
              <li>Systems Analysis</li>
              <li>Accounting</li>
              <li>Training</li>
