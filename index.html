                            <p>My name is Anthony. I'm a web and mobile developer, entrepreneur, student, leader and overall technophile. Currently, I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and am starting my last year at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. This is just some of the story of my journey through technology.</p>

                            <p>Ever since I received my first computer for my 8th birthday, I knew I wanted to do something with technology one day. Some of my earliest memories in technology include experimenting in Microsoft FrontPage, creating a website for my pets on a free web host and showing that yes, magnets do break hard drives. I strongly give credit to my parents for encouraging me to explore my dreams and think of innovative ways to improve our world.</p>

                            <p>In high school is when I truly became involved in the computer and information sciences. I became involved in our Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) chapter, and decided to compete in Web Design. Junior year, my entry went to the national competition, where it placed 3rd. Senior year, I won the Distinguished Business Leader scholarship, the highest award in FBLA. I served as a teaching assistant for a web design class, helped out the school's IT department, and passed the AP Computer Science exam. I also started a web and mobile development business, now Planitari Digital Solutions LLC.</p>

The center is meant to support the Univerisity's mission by providing development and design services for research, non-profit organizations, and UWM partners. I worked as a Lead Student Developer on web and mobile applications for fields including medical research, public transportation, tourism, LGBT activism, domestic violence awareness, and education. My duties included being a mentor to aspiring developers, a speaker on the importance of technical literacy, and a teaching assistant to mobile development classes at UWM.</p>

                            <p>I am currently the Google Student Ambassador for the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Student Ambassadors are Google employees whose act as liasons between Google and their universities. As part of my position, I have hosted workshops, marketed internships and other opportunities, and formed great connections with divisions on campus. I also manage a team of student volunteers and work with other Student Ambassadors as part of an international distributed team. Plus, I spent 3 days at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, to train and learn more about Google, which was a lot of fun.</p>

                            <p>At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, I am also a Teaching Assistant with the School of Information Studies. My duties involve working under the direction of a faculty member, assisting with the instruction of web and mobile development classes, reviewing student code and offering feedback, and holding office hours for students to come in for help. Teaching has always been one of my non-technical passions, and being a TA is helping me grow both as a person and as a developer. It's also inspiring for me to see that I'm helping others eventually enter or at least consider a career in the development field.</p>

I would like to complete an internship for summer 2015 and potentially pursue another opportunity in the fall alongside my last semester. Fields that interest me include User Experience, Product / Project Management, and Software Development / Engineering, but I'm open to hearing about other opportunities.</p>
